1)Try some of the other SIMD instructions and see how they behave.
2)Calculate some timing information for the normalization application
3)Try and parallelize the normalization application using multithreading or OpenMP. Compare the time taken against SIMD.
4)Monte Carlo π works on the principal of the length of a random vector. Can you build a version of Monte Carlo π using SIMD instructions? Can you also parallelize it further using OpenMP or multithreading?
5)A _m512 type is supported by some processors. Try it on your machine and add new timing information for the addition application.
